# Simple MUD in RUBY without DB
## Running the game

```ruby
ruby run.rb
```
## Stuff
This is an attempt to get started on a basic Object based MUD in RUBY.
It seems that storing items on a csv based map model sux, so it might be time to move on to active record.

Most basic settings to connect db to ruby with active record and without rails [link](https://til.codes/connecting-a-ruby-app-to-active-record-without-rails/).

A longer, more detailed version [link](https://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/257-How-to-use-ActiveRecord-without-Rails).

There is also a way to just create a DB in sqlite3 and use that.
