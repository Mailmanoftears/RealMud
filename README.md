# Simple MUD in RUBY without DB

This is an attempt to get started on a basic Object based MUD in RUBY.
In order to test it just run:

```ruby
ruby run.rb
```
It seems that storing items on a csv based map model sux, so it might be time to move on to active record.

A longer, more detailed version [link](https://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/257-How-to-use-ActiveRecord-without-Rails).

There is also a way to just create a DB in sqlite3 and use that.
