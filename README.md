You wake up in a alley and find your eyes filled with this text:

Pain                  
 The ********** is long gone but his memories pain
 the peoples ancestors so much that they forbid his name,
your mission is to find it out and why
....                                  
even if  you die trying....                       
in case you need help try to go find a man named  
merith, he usually hangs around the market and
could help you with some rare information.       

...
Yeah weird maybe you should check that out(in work)
